## Introduction
Nenbody is intended to be a multi-agent 2d simulation for simple control algorithms and computer vision processing. 

## Demos
[Basic vision with gravity controller](https://youtu.be/SQn7Y11cVWA)

This demo shows single channel vision, scaled from a 1d line of pixels to a 2d image in the viewport. A simple nbody gravity simulation is controlling the movement of each entity.

This demo shows single channel vision, scaled from a 1d line of pixels to a 2d image in the viewport. A crude attempt at a flocking algorithm controls the movement of each entity, and maintains a stable set of neighbors in view. Note that this controller has access to the location of each entity, and is not using the visual data.
